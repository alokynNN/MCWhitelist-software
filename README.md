MCWHITELIST is an authentication and access-control software designed for Minecraft servers.
It connects directly to the MCWHITELIST backend and acts as a bridge between the backend system and Minecraft servers protected by MCWhitelist.

The software verifies player access by communicating with the MCWHITELIST backend before or during a player’s connection to the server. When a player attempts to join, the system checks whether the player is authorized (whitelisted) according to the rules and data stored in the backend. If the authentication is successful, the player is allowed to join; otherwise, access is denied.

This approach centralizes whitelist management, making it easier for server administrators to control access across one or multiple Minecraft servers from a single backend system. It improves security, reduces manual whitelist management, and ensures that only approved players can connect to protected servers.

MCWHITELIST is typically used in private, premium, or community-managed Minecraft environments where controlled access and reliable authentication are important.
Users have full rights to modify the software for their own purposes. They are free to adapt, extend, or customize the software to fit their specific needs, whether for personal use, private servers, or custom integrations, as long as such modifications are used responsibly.
